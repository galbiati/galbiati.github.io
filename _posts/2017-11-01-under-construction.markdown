Leaving some notes on markdown for later reference:

`code inline`

{% highlight python %}
# this is a python snippet
def say_hello(name):
    print('Hello, {}!'.format(name))
    return
say_hello('friend')
# > 'Hello, friend!'
{% endhighlight %}

Posts should be named `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` in `_posts` dir.

`jekyll serve` to live preview.
